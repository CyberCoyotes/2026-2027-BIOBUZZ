/*
 * Turret Testing
 * An iterative OpMode that tests the TurretSubsystem using gamepad2.
 *
 * CONTROLS (all on gamepad2)
 *   Left Stick X      -> MANUAL turning. Push the stick RIGHT and the turret turns RIGHT.
 *   D-pad Left        -> HOLD to turn the turret LEFT
 *   D-pad Right       -> HOLD to turn the turret RIGHT
 *   D-pad Up          -> turret POWER up by TURRET_POWER_PERCENT_STEP (one step per press)
 *   D-pad Down        -> turret POWER down by TURRET_POWER_PERCENT_STEP (one step per press)
 *   X (Square on PS5) -> PRESET: turn to FAR LEFT, +PRESET_SIDE_DEGREES (about +90)
 *   B (Circle on PS5) -> PRESET: turn to FAR RIGHT, -PRESET_SIDE_DEGREES (about -90)
 *   Y (Triangle)      -> PRESET: turn to CENTER, 0 degrees (0 encoder ticks, straight ahead)
 *   A (Cross on PS5)  -> STOP driving the turret. It floats so you can turn it by hand.
 *   Letting go of the stick or the D-pad Left / Right holds the turret where it is.
 *   A preset runs until the turret gets there, then holds. Press another button to change it.
 *   Priority: stick, then D-pad Left / Right, then Y, X, B, then A.
 *
 *   The presets use the ANGLE, so they only land in the right place if the angle is right.
 *   Do the "marked 90 degrees" check in the safe first test below BEFORE you use them.
 *   The presets use their own position-control power (MAX_POWER in TurretSubsystem),
 *   not the Turret power dial.
 *
 * TURRET POWER is how fast the turret turns. It starts at DEFAULT_TURRET_POWER_PERCENT (100%).
 * A full push on the stick, or holding D-pad Left / Right, turns the turret at this power.
 * A half push on the stick turns it at half of this power.
 *
 * ANGLES: left (counterclockwise) is POSITIVE, right is NEGATIVE, 0 is straight ahead.
 *
 * THE ANGLE LIMITS ARE ON: the turret will not be driven past +/-120 degrees (SOFT_LIMITS_ON,
 * MIN_ANGLE_DEGREES and MAX_ANGLE_DEGREES in TurretSubsystem). They are measured from 0 degrees,
 * so power on with the turret pointing straight ahead. They only work if the angle is right,
 * so do the first test below before trusting them, and keep your hand near the Stop button.
 *
 * HOME SWITCH IS OFF FOR NOW (not installed). 0 degrees is wherever the turret was when the
 * Control Hub powered on, so power on with the turret pointing straight ahead.
 *
 * SAFE FIRST TEST (do these in order, and keep your hand near the Stop button):
 *   1. INIT. Turn the turret LEFT by hand. The angle must go UP. If it goes down, flip
 *      INVERT_ENCODER_READING in TurretSubsystem. (Do NOT flip TURRET_MOTOR_DIRECTION for this.
 *      It would also reverse the motor and the encoder together, and change nothing here.)
 *   2. Check ticks per degree: start with the turret straight ahead, then turn it by hand
 *      through a marked 90 degrees. The angle should read about 90. If not, check the tooth
 *      counts in TurretSubsystem.
 *   3. START. Push the stick a LITTLE to the right. The turret must turn RIGHT and the angle
 *      must go DOWN. If the turret turns the wrong way, flip TURRET_MOTOR_DIRECTION.
 *   4. Hold D-pad Left and Right. The turret must turn only while held, and stop when you let
 *      go. Press D-pad Up and Down and watch the Turret power line change.
 *   5. Try the presets from the center: Y should stay put, X should swing LEFT and B should
 *      swing RIGHT, each stopping at about 90 degrees on the screen. Press A to stop it.
 *   6. Last, test the limits: from the center, push the stick slowly to one side. The turret
 *      must stop at about 120 degrees (or -120 on the right) and stay there. Then check that it
 *      still moves back toward the middle.
 *
 * On a PS5 controller: A = Cross, B = Circle, X = Square, Y = Triangle.
 *
 * Robot configuration (on the Driver Station):
 *   Motor name:           turret_motor        (goBILDA 5203 motor; its encoder cable is plugged
 *                                              into the same port's encoder connector)
 *   (Home switch, Digital Device "turret_home_sensor": not installed yet, so not needed.)
 *
 * HIDDEN FROM THE DRIVER STATION LIST
 *   TeleOp - Alpha 8 has the turret stick, the presets and ALWAYS-TRACK built in, so this
 *   OpMode is @Disabled to keep the list short. The code is all still here. To bring it back
 *   (for example to recheck the turret direction, limits or speed, issue #35), put // in front
 *   of the @Disabled line below and redeploy.
