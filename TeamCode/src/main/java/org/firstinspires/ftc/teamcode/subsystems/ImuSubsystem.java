/*
 * IMU Subsystem
 * Owns the Control Hub's BUILT-IN gyroscope (the "IMU"). It only READS. It never moves a motor and
 * has no gamepad code. Another class (for now TeleOp - Alpha 13 and ImuAlpha) asks it which way the
 * robot is facing.
 *
 * WHY WE HAVE IT: the field-centric drive needs the robot's HEADING. It used to take it from the
 * Pinpoint, but the Pinpoint is a separate gadget on an I2C cable, and when it blinks (a cable
 * wiggles, the battery sags) the heading goes with it and field-centric had to give up. This
 * gyroscope is INSIDE the Control Hub, on the hub's own internal wiring, so it has no cable to
 * wiggle. The drive now asks THIS class for its heading, and the Pinpoint only helps the turret.
 *
 * WHAT IT ANSWERS: "Which way is the robot facing, compared to where it was at INIT?"
 *   getHeadingDegrees()  -> turning LEFT (counterclockwise) is POSITIVE, from -180 to 180.
 * That is the same sign as PinpointSubsystem, TurretSubsystem and Pedro Pathing, so the drive math
 * does not change. Zero is the way the robot faced when this class was created (at INIT).
 *
 * THE HUB'S ORIENTATION (the one thing you must get right): the IMU has no idea how the hub is
 * bolted to the robot, so we tell it with two directions: which way the REV LOGO on the hub faces,
 * and which way the USB PORTS face. If they are wrong, the heading is wrong (it can even run
 * backwards, or change when the robot tips). ImuAlpha checks them in a minute.
 * The two directions must be on DIFFERENT axes (logo UP with USB UP is physically impossible). If
 * they are not, the SDK refuses them. This class catches that, writes it in the log, and says so on
 * the screen, and the TeleOp drives ROBOT-CENTRIC. It never crashes the OpMode over it.
 *
 * It does NOT need the robot to be still at INIT (the hub calibrates itself when it powers on).
 * Resetting the heading to zero is instant.
 *
 * ABSENT DEVICE: if the robot's configuration has no device named IMU_NAME, this class does NOT
 * stop the OpMode. isAvailable() is false, the heading stays 0, and the telemetry says what to fix.
 * (The TeleOp then drives ROBOT-CENTRIC and says so on the screen.)
 *
 * The OpMode must call update() ONCE per loop(). Nothing calls it for us.
 *
 * Robot configuration (on the Driver Station):
 *   The Control Hub's built-in IMU is called "imu" ("IMU (BHI260AP)" on newer Control Hubs, or
 *   "IMU (BNO055)" on older ones). A new configuration normally has it already. If it is missing,
 *   open the Control Hub in the configuration, go to I2C Bus 0, and add the IMU there, named imu.
