/*
 * Shot Table
 * Answers one question: "How fast should the FLYWHEEL spin for a shot from here?"
 * The "here" is the Limelight's ty: how far UP the hive's AprilTags appear in the camera view.
 *
 * WHY ty AND NOT DISTANCE
 *   The camera is bolted to the turret, so it always looks the same way. Tags that are CLOSER
 *   appear HIGHER in the view, which means a BIGGER ty. Tags that are FARTHER appear lower, which
 *   means a SMALLER ty. So ty already tells us how far away we are, and we do not need the camera
 *   height or the camera tilt angle. (If the camera is ever moved or re-tilted, the ty values
 *   change, so measure the table again.)
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS
 *   The table below is a list of spots that students measured on the real field. Each spot has:
 *     - the ty the camera showed there, and
 *     - the flywheel RPM that scored from there.
 *   For a ty between two spots, we draw a straight line between them and read off the RPM
 *   (that is called linear interpolation). For a ty OUTSIDE the table we use the nearest spot.
 *   We never guess past the edges, because a wild RPM from a bad reading is worse than a
 *   slightly wrong one.
 *
 * THE HOOD WHEEL
 *   This table has only ONE RPM per spot, for the flywheel. The hood wheel runs at the flywheel
 *   RPM x HOOD_WHEEL_RATIO (see ShooterSubsystem). Pass the answer to
 *   ShooterSubsystem.setTargetRpm(), which does that multiplication for you.
 *   ShooterSubsystem cuts any target above MAX_TARGET_RPM, and the hood wheel is the first to
 *   hit it. At a ratio of 2.0 the flywheel can only go up to MAX_TARGET_RPM / 2 = 2700 RPM.
 *   So do not put a flywheel RPM above 2700 in this table.
 *
 * HOW TO EDIT IT (after a ShotTableAlpha session)
 *   1. Type each measured spot into the two lists below. Keep them in the SAME ORDER, and keep
 *      the ty list going from SMALLEST to BIGGEST (that is, from far away to close up).
 *   2. Both lists must be the same length. The first row of one list goes with the first
 *      row of the other.
 *   3. Redeploy and check a few spots with ShotTableAlpha's Left Trigger.
 *
 * This class owns no hardware and never reads a gamepad. Nothing needs update() either:
 * ask it a question and it answers.
