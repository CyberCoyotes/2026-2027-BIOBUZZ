/*
 * Alpha-Shooter Testing
 * An iterative OpMode that tests the whole ball path with three subsystems:
 *   ShooterSubsystem       -> the FLYWHEEL and the HOOD WHEEL (plain POWER, no speed control)
 *   ShooterServoSubsystem  -> the shooter GATE servo
 *   IntakeSubsystem        -> the INTAKE (which also runs the transfer)
 * This OpMode owns NO hardware itself. It only reads the gamepads and tells the subsystems
 * what to do. (ShooterRPMAlpha is the speed-control version of the wheel tests.)
 *
 * TWO CONTROLLERS: the shooter and gate are on gamepad1, the intake is on gamepad2.
 * That keeps the buttons from fighting each other, because both jobs want the bumpers and D-pad.
 *
 * ------------------------- GAMEPAD 1: SHOOTER + GATE -------------------------
 * HOLD a button to run BOTH the flywheel and the hood wheel.
 * Each motor has its OWN power number for each button, so you can tune them
 * separately. Starting values (flywheel / hood wheel):
 *   Y  -> 60% / 60%   (see the note below)
 *   X  -> 55% / 55%   (see the note below)
 *   No button -> both coast to a stop
 * These two were the closest shots in testing with BOTH wheels on 6000 RPM motors.
 *
 * NOTE: THE FLYWHEEL IS NOW THE 1620 RPM MOTOR. The same POWER now spins the flywheel about
 * 3.7 times slower (60% is about 970 RPM with no load, not 3600), so these power shots are NOT
 * the same shots any more. The hood wheel is still the 6000 RPM motor (60% -> 3600 RPM, 55% ->
 * 3300 RPM with no load). To see the real speeds, hold Y or X and read "Flywheel RPM" and
 * "Hood Wheel RPM" in the shooter section of the telemetry. With a ball and the wheel's own
 * drag the real speed is LOWER than no load, and it drops as the battery drains.
 * For shots, use ShooterRPMAlpha (speed control in RPM) instead of these power shots.
 *
 * REVERSE (for clearing a jam, 60% power the other way):
 *   Right Bumper -> reverses the FLYWHEEL only
 *   Left Bumper  -> reverses the HOOD WHEEL only
 *
 * A reverse bumper beats the shooter buttons for that motor.
 * If more than one shooter button is held, the HIGHEST power wins.
 *
 * SHOOTER GATE (the servo), separate from the wheel buttons above:
 *   Left Trigger -> TOGGLES the gate between CLOSED and OPENED (one flip per press)
 *   D-pad Up     -> nudge the gate's CURRENT position toward 1.0 (small step)
 *   D-pad Down   -> nudge the gate's CURRENT position toward 0.0 (small step)
 * The gate positions are not measured yet. Use the D-pad nudge to creep the gate to the
 * right spot for each state, read the number on the screen, and then type it into
 * CLOSED_POSITION / OPENED_POSITION / LIFTED_POSITION in ShooterServoSubsystem.
 * The gate starts CLOSED when you hit INIT. It does NOT depend on the wheels.
 * (This OpMode can't reach the gate's third position, LIFTED. Shooter RPM - Alpha 2 can.)
 *
 * ------------------------- GAMEPAD 2: INTAKE -------------------------
 * HOLD a bumper to run the intake. There is ONE power dial, and the D-pad turns it up and down.
 *   Right Bumper -> INTAKE (pull balls in) at the dial power
 *   Left Bumper  -> REVERSE (push balls out) at the dial power
 *   D-pad Up     -> turn the dial UP by 5% (each press)
 *   D-pad Down   -> turn the dial DOWN by 5% (each press)
 *   No bumper    -> intake stops
 * Left Bumper beats Right Bumper, so clearing a jam always works.
 *
 * THE POWER DIAL IS FOR TESTING ONLY. When this test shows us the best number, change
 * DEFAULT_INTAKE_POWER at the top of IntakeSubsystem.
 *
 * THE INTAKE ALSO RUNS THE TRANSFER. One motor spins the front intake AND a hex shaft with
 * grippers in the transfer chute. Test with a few balls loaded in the chute.
 * KEEP HANDS AND BALLS CLEAR OF THE FLYWHEEL when you run the intake and shooter together.
 *
 * On a PS5 controller: A = Cross, B = Circle, X = Square, Y = Triangle, bumpers = L1 / R1.
 *
 * Robot configuration (on the Driver Station). The NAMES live in each subsystem class,
 * so check them there if they ever change:
 *   Motor name: flywheel      (ShooterSubsystem,       goBILDA 5202/3/4 series)
 *   Motor name: hood_wheel     (ShooterSubsystem,       goBILDA 5202/3/4 series)
 *   Motor name: intake        (IntakeSubsystem,        goBILDA 5202/3/4 series)
 *   Servo name: shooter_servo (ShooterServoSubsystem,  goBILDA dual mode servo, POSITIONAL mode)
 * The motor directions are set inside the subsystems, not in this file.
 *
 * HIDDEN FROM THE DRIVER STATION LIST
 *   The shooter now runs on speed control (RPM), and ShooterRPMAlpha and TeleOp - Alpha 10 cover
 *   everything this open-loop POWER test did, so this OpMode is @Disabled to keep the list short.
 *   The code is all still here. To bring it back (for example for the raw ticks/sec jitter test
 *   in issue #43), put // in front of the @Disabled line below and redeploy.
