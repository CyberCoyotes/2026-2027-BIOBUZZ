/*
 * Hive Bearing Memory
 * A plain class with NO hardware, no update(), and no gamepad code. It is not a mechanism, so its
 * name does not end in "Subsystem" (the same as ShotTable). It does one job: REMEMBER which
 * direction the hive was in the last time the camera saw it, so the turret can keep pointing that
 * way when the camera loses the hive.
 *
 * WHY THE DIRECTION IS "FIELD" DIRECTION
 *   The turret angle is measured from the robot, so when the robot spins, the turret angle has to
 *   change to keep pointing at the same spot. But a direction measured on the FIELD does not
 *   change when the robot spins. The Pinpoint tells us the robot's heading, so:
 *       direction to the hive, on the field = robotHeading + turretAngle - tx
 *       turret angle that points at it      = that direction - robotHeading
 *   (tx is positive to the RIGHT, and every other angle here is positive to the LEFT, so tx is
 *   subtracted, the same flip the auto-align already does.)
 *   The Pinpoint's heading starts at 0 wherever the robot sat at INIT, and that is fine: we only
 *   ever compare headings from the same match, so the starting direction never matters.
 *
 * WHEN THE MEMORY IS NOT TRUSTED (STALE)
 *   Spinning does not change the direction to the hive, but DRIVING does. Driving sideways or
 *   forward moves the robot, so the real direction to the hive changes, and heading alone cannot
 *   see it. So the memory is stale when the robot has driven more than
 *   MAX_DRIVE_SINCE_SEEN_INCHES since the camera last saw the hive (the Pinpoint's X and Y
 *   measure that), or when more than MAX_HOLD_SECONDS have passed.
 *   Spinning in place barely changes X and Y, so a spin never makes the memory stale.
 *
 * HOW THE OPMODE USES IT
 *   Every loop the camera sees the hive:  remember(...)
 *   Every loop it does not:               if hasMemory() and not isStale(...), aim the turret at
 *                                         getTurretAngleDegrees(robotHeading).
 *   When the alliance changes:            clear(), so we never aim at the other hive's direction.
 *
 * ONE LIMIT: the two cells of our hive are on the same frame, only about 19 inches apart, so one
 * remembered direction works for either side of the hive. It cannot tell which side is raised.
 * (VisionSubsystem decides that from the tags.)
