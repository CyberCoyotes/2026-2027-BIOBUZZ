/*
 * Auto - Emergency Leave (A-0), Alpha 1
 * The simplest Auto there is (rung A-0 in TeamCode/docs/biobuzz-auto-strategy.md). The robot drives
 * straight FORWARD for a fixed time and stops. That is LEAVE = 3 points, as long as the robot is
 * no longer touching the perimeter wall when AUTO ends.
 *
 * WHEN TO USE IT
 *   - Pedro Pathing is not tuned yet (FORESIGHT_TUNED is false), so LeaveAndParkAuto will not
 *     drive. This is the stopgap until it is tuned.
 *   - Or something else is broken at an event (the Pinpoint is not READY, the camera is dead) and
 *     we want to be sure of the 3 LEAVE points.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS (and why it is only "good enough")
 *   It uses DriveSubsystem, the same class as the TeleOp, and NOTHING else: no Pedro, no
 *   Pinpoint, no camera. It does not know where the robot is. It just sends the same power for the
 *   same time. So the distance depends on the battery (a weaker battery goes less far) and on the
 *   floor, and it does NOT park in the LOADING ZONE. The zone is too far away to hit with a
 *   timer. Parking needs Pedro.
 *
 * WHERE THE ROBOT STARTS
 *   The same start spot as the other Autos: back against the wall, facing the hive. Blue is tile
 *   D6 (top wall, facing down), red is tile C1 (bottom wall, facing up). "Forward" is always
 *   toward the hive, so the same OpMode works for both alliances. Nothing needs to be chosen.
 *   The robot must be inside the 18 inch cube, touching the wall, not in the LOADING ZONE and not
 *   touching a flower. (All of that is in pedro/FieldConstants.java.)
 *
 * HOW TO TUNE IT (all at the top of this file)
 *   1. Start with DRIVE_POWER 0.30 and DRIVE_SECONDS 0.80. Put the robot against the wall, with a
 *      clear floor in front of it (the hive is about 40 inches away on the real field).
 *   2. Run it and measure how far the robot moved. We want about 12 inches: enough to be clearly
 *      off the wall, and far from the hive.
 *   3. Change DRIVE_SECONDS (a bigger number goes farther), run again. Keep DRIVE_POWER low.
 *   4. Run it 5 times in a row with a freshly charged battery, and once with a tired battery,
 *      and write the distances in TeamCode/docs/biobuzz-test-and-match-log.md. If the distance
 *      changes a lot, pick a number that is still safe with the tired battery.
 *
 * Nothing moves during INIT (rule G403). The robot only moves after START. Stop it any time with
 * the Driver Station STOP button.
