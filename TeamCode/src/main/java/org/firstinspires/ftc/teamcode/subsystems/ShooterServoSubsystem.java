/*
 * Shooter Servo Subsystem
 * Owns the shooter GATE servo (goBILDA dual mode, 300 degree torque servo).
 * Only this class touches that servo. OpModes call its methods.
 *
 * The gate has THREE places it can be:
 *   CLOSED -> the gate holds the balls back, so balls can be loaded into the shooter.
 *   OPENED -> the gate lets a ball pass into a flywheel and shooter that are ready.
 *   LIFTED -> the gate lifts to push the LAST ball into the shooter.
 *
 * goToClosed(), goToOpened() and goToLifted() pick one on purpose. toggle() flips between
 * CLOSED and OPENED only (from LIFTED it goes to CLOSED). The test OpModes that only need
 * "shut" and "open" use it.
 *
 * STATE (what we told the gate to do) is CLOSED, OPENED or LIFTED.
 * A servo cannot tell us where it really is, so there is no sensor STATUS here.
 * The closest thing is isAtPosition(): it is true once SERVO_TRAVEL_SECONDS have passed
 * since the last command, which is our guess that the gate has finished moving.
 *
 * Nothing calls update() for this class, because there is no ongoing work.
 * A timer is all the gate needs, and isAtPosition() reads that timer itself.
 *
 * Robot configuration (on the Driver Station):
 *   Servo name: shooter_servo   (goBILDA dual mode servo, configured as a plain "Servo")
 * The dual mode servo must be set to POSITIONAL mode (not continuous) with the goBILDA
 * Servo Programmer. In continuous mode these position commands would spin it instead.
