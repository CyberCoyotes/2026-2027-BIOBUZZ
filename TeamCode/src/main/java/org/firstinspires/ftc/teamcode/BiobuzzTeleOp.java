/*
 * TeleOp Alpha 14
 * An iterative OpMode with TWO controllers:
 *   gamepad1 = the DRIVER: drives the robot, runs the INTAKE, and holds the trigger to FIRE a volley
 *              (the FIRING SEQUENCE, see the change log, Alpha 13).
 *              (The turret AUTO-TRACKS the hive ALL THE TIME, see ALWAYS-TRACK below.)
 *   gamepad2 = the OPERATOR: sets the shooter speeds (RPM), moves the GATE, and can run the
 *              INTAKE too. The operator does NOT aim the turret by hand any more.
 * It is DriveAlpha, IntakeAlpha, ShooterRPMAlpha, TurretAlpha, VisionAlpha, ShotTableAlpha and
 * PinpointAlpha put together, so each part has already been tested on its own. This OpMode owns
 * NO hardware. It only reads the gamepads and tells the subsystems what to do.
 *
 * HISTORY: what changed in each Alpha (14 back to 8: the IMU drive and the battery black box, the
 * firing sequence, the control changes,
 * field-centric drive, the safer Pinpoint heading follow, the Pinpoint helping the turret, odometry
 * on the screen) used to be written here, and it was longer than the code it described. It now
 * lives in TeamCode/docs/biobuzz-teleop-change-log.md, newest first, so THIS header only says how
 * the TeleOp works right now.
 *
 * THE FIRING SEQUENCE IN ONE PARAGRAPH (issue #63): the OPERATOR holds Right Trigger (gamepad2) to fire
 * a volley. The wheels spin, and the volley WAITS until the flywheel is at speed AND the turret is
 * aimed. Then the gate OPENS and STAYS OPEN, and the intake feeds balls until the trigger is let go:
 * the gate closes and the intake reverses for a moment (CLOSE_REVERSE_SECONDS in
 * ShooterServoSubsystem). Holding Y lifts the gate to push the last ball in. The driver's D-pad Up is
 * PRE-REV (wheels on without firing). The driver's Right Trigger, Y and B (forced shot) only work in SOLO MODE
 * (gamepad1 LOGO), for a match with one person. The steps live in subsystems/FiringSequence.java.
 *
 * GAMEPAD 2 (the operator) has NO layers. Every button always does the same thing:
 *   X -> shooter GATE CLOSED (holds the ball back)
 *   B -> HOLD for a FORCED SHOT: wheels on, gate OPENED and intake running right now, even when the
 *        READY checks say "not ready". Let go and the gate CLOSES (with the intake reversing for that
 *        moment). See the change log, Alpha 14, item 6. (B used to be a one-press "gate OPENED" button.)
 *   Y -> HOLD for shooter GATE LIFTED (pushes the very last ball up into the flywheel; with no ball
 *        behind it, nothing else would). OPENED is the position BETWEEN LIFTED and CLOSED.
 *        (The driver's Y does the same, but ONLY in SOLO MODE. Everything below works the same
 *        for either gamepad's Y.)
 *        - While a volley FEEDS (the trigger is held, the wheels are at speed): hold Y to LIFT, let
 *          go and the gate goes back to OPENED and the volley carries on.
 *        - Between volleys: hold Y to LIFT, let go and the gate CLOSES (with the intake
 *          reversing for that moment, see GATE CLOSING AUTO-REVERSE).
 *        - While a volley WAITS: ignored.
 *      X is ONE move per press. The gate positions are CLOSED_POSITION, OPENED_POSITION and
 *       LIFTED_POSITION in ShooterServoSubsystem. If X and Y are pressed on the same loop,
 *       CLOSED wins. X only works BETWEEN volleys: during a volley (and a forced shot) the
 *       firing sequence is in charge of the gate, see the change log, Alpha 13.)
 *   A -> HOLD to STOP the turret (it floats, so you can turn it by hand). Let go and it goes
 *        back to tracking the hive.
 *   D-pad Up / Down  -> flywheel target RPM +/- FLYWHEEL_RPM_STEP
 *   D-pad Right / Left -> ratio (hood wheel / flywheel) +/- 0.05
 *   Right Trigger    -> HOLD to FIRE a volley (the FIRING SEQUENCE, see the change log, Alpha 13). The turret is
 *                       already tracking the hive (ALWAYS-TRACK). The wheels run at the flywheel
 *                       speed from the DIAL or the TABLE (see THE SHOT TABLE below), and the hood
 *                       wheel at that x the ratio dial. Let go to ABORT: the gate closes, the
 *                       intake stops, and (unless PRE-REV is ON) both wheels go to 0 power. A (hold)
 *                       floats the turret, so then a volley waits (the screen says it is floating).
 *   Start            -> switch alliance BLUE <-> RED (starts as BLUE). Check it on the screen!
 *                       (Gamepad1's START does the same.)
 *   Back             -> switch the DRIVE FIELD-CENTRIC <-> ROBOT-CENTRIC (starts FIELD-CENTRIC).
 *                       (Gamepad1's BACK does the same.)
 *   LOGO             -> switch the flywheel speed source DIAL <-> TABLE (starts as TABLE, the camera)
 *   Left Trigger     -> HOLD for a WALL SHOT (issue #9): a dumb shot from a known spot, up against the wall.
 *                       The turret goes straight ahead (WALL_SHOT_TURRET_DEGREES) and both wheels run at
 *                       fixed speeds (WALL_SHOT_FLYWHEEL_RPM, WALL_SHOT_HOOD_WHEEL_RPM) right away. After
 *                       WALL_SHOT_GATE_DELAY_SECONDS the gate OPENS and the intake runs, the same as the
 *                       FORCED SHOT (B): no camera, no READY checks. Let go and the gate CLOSES (with the
 *                       intake reversing for that moment) and the wheels go to 0 power (unless PRE-REV is
 *                       on). While it is held, B and the Right Trigger do nothing. A still floats the
 *                       turret. There is no SOLO MODE copy: the driver's Left Trigger is SLOW MODE.
 *   Both sticks, both bumpers: not used. (The intake is the driver's only.)
 *   The turret has no other operator control. It tracks the hive all the time (see ALWAYS-TRACK
 *   below). It will not go past +/-120 degrees (see TurretSubsystem). 0 degrees is where
 *   the turret pointed when the Control Hub powered on, because the home switch is not
 *   installed yet, so power on with the turret pointing straight ahead.
 *
 * It starts FIELD-CENTRIC: "forward" means AWAY FROM THE DRIVER (see the change log, Alpha 11). ROBOT-CENTRIC
 * ("forward" means the way the robot is facing) is one press of the drive toggle away.
 * WHICH GYRO THE DRIVE USES: the Control Hub's built-in IMU (ImuSubsystem), NOT the Pinpoint. The
 * IMU is inside the hub with no cable to wiggle, so a Pinpoint blink can no longer drop the drive
 * out of field-centric, and there is no "safety rule" that switches it off by itself any more (the
 * Alpha 11 notes in the change log describe the old one). The Pinpoint still feeds the turret's
 * hive memory. If the config has no IMU, the drive is ROBOT-CENTRIC and the screen says so.
 *
 * GAMEPAD 1 - DRIVER
 *   Left Stick   -> drive forward / backward and slide (strafe) left / right
 *   Right Stick  -> turn (push right to turn right)
 *   HOLD the Left Trigger -> SLOW MODE for careful lining up
 *   D-pad Left   -> RE-AIM: "the way the robot faces right now is away from me" (field-centric).
 *      It only changes which way "forward" means. It does not reset the IMU or the Pinpoint.
 *   D-pad Up     -> PRE-REV on / off: the wheels spin without firing (see the change log, Alpha 13).
 *   START        -> switch alliance BLUE <-> RED, the same as gamepad2's START.
 *   BACK         -> switch the drive FIELD-CENTRIC <-> ROBOT-CENTRIC, the same as gamepad2's BACK.
 *   Right Bumper -> INTAKE (pull balls in)      Left Bumper -> REVERSE (push balls out)
 *      (Left Bumper beats Right Bumper, so clearing a jam always works. Only the DRIVER has the
 *       intake: the operator's bumpers do nothing. The intake runs at the power set in
 *       IntakeSubsystem, DEFAULT_INTAKE_POWER.)
 *   LOGO (the center "guide" button) -> SOLO MODE on / off, for a match with one person (see NEW IN
 *      ALPHA 13). It starts OFF.
 *   Right Trigger -> does NOT fire. The OPERATOR's Right Trigger fires. Only in SOLO MODE (LOGO) does
 *      the driver's Right Trigger fire too. At the start the shot is DIAL mode, flywheel 1300 RPM and
 *      hood wheel 2600 RPM (a ratio of 2.00).
 *   Y (HOLD)     -> ONLY in SOLO MODE (LOGO): shooter GATE LIFTED, the same as the operator's Y (see
 *      GAMEPAD 2 below, and issue #78). With SOLO MODE off, the driver's Y does nothing.
 *   B (HOLD)     -> ONLY in SOLO MODE (LOGO): the FORCED SHOT, the same as the operator's B (see GAMEPAD 2
 *      below, and issue #80). With SOLO MODE off, the driver's B does nothing.
 *   X            -> not used. (The shooter gate is the operator's X / Y.)
 *
 * GAMEPAD 2 - OPERATOR, SHOOTER DIALS (SPEED CONTROL in RPM, read from the wheel encoders)
 *   D-pad Up / Down    -> flywheel target RPM UP / DOWN by FLYWHEEL_RPM_STEP
 *   D-pad Right / Left -> ratio UP / DOWN by 0.05
 *   The hood wheel target RPM is flywheel RPM x ratio (RATIO = HOOD WHEEL / FLYWHEEL). The
 *   shooter will not go past each wheel's own maximum (the flywheel motor is the 1620 RPM one,
 *   so its maximum is only 1458 RPM). If a wheel would be over its maximum, the screen says
 *   CAPPED and the real ratio is lower than the dial says.
 *   (The shooter wheels can no longer be reversed from this OpMode. ShooterRPMAlpha and
 *   ShooterPowerAlpha can still run them backward, for testing.)
 *   The screen shows "OK to shoot" only when BOTH wheels are really at their target RPM
 *   (the shooter's isAtSpeed()). It drops back to WAIT after a ball slows the wheels.
 *   ShooterRPMAlpha has the same wheel speed control on its own, for testing.
 *
 * THE SHOT TABLE (TABLE mode, switched with gamepad2 LOGO)
 *   The Limelight is on the turret. It reads ty, how far UP the hive's AprilTags appear in its
 *   view, and ShotTable turns that into a flywheel RPM. (Closer = bigger ty = lower RPM.)
 *   - DIAL mode: the flywheel uses the operator's dial, exactly like before. This is the safe
 *     fallback that needs no camera.
 *   - TABLE mode: while the camera sees the hive, the flywheel uses the table's RPM. If the
 *     camera loses the hive, it keeps the LAST table RPM for TABLE_RPM_HOLD_SECONDS so the wheels
 *     do not lurch, then goes back to the dial. The screen says which one is being used.
 *   - The camera can only see the hive when the turret points at it. ALWAYS-TRACK (below) keeps
 *     the turret pointed at it.
 *   - AUTO-ALIGN: the camera is ON the turret, so tx is how far the turret still has to turn.
 *     tx is positive to the RIGHT but turret angles are positive to the LEFT, so the new turret
 *     target is the turret angle NOW minus tx. If the camera loses the hive, the turret holds
 *     where it is. It does not search.
 *   - FOLLOWING THE ROBOT'S SPIN: auto-align alone only pushes once the turret is already off
 *     target, so when the driver turns the robot the turret always trails it. So while it aligns,
 *     the turret also gets a push the opposite way to the driver's turn (TURRET_FEEDFORWARD_GAIN).
 *     The screen shows it as "Turret follows spin". Tune the gain on the robot.
 *   - The table was measured aiming at one hive from a few spots, see ShotTable. Outside those
 *     spots it uses the nearest row, and the screen warns you.
 *
 * ALWAYS-TRACK (new in Alpha 7, and since issue #74 it is ALWAYS ON: there is no switch)
 *   The turret aligns on the hive ALL THE TIME, the whole match, with no button held. It uses
 *   the AUTO-ALIGN above, including following the robot's spin.
 *   - It does NOT run during INIT, because the robot must not move before START.
 *   - If the camera cannot see the hive, the turret HOLDS where it is. It does not search.
 *   - The operator's A (hold) floats the turret so it can be turned by hand. Let go of A and it
 *     goes back to tracking.
 *   - The ALLIANCE (START on either gamepad) must be right, or the turret tracks the OTHER team's hive.
 *     It starts as BLUE. Check the alliance on the screen before you press START.
 *
 * THE INTAKE ALSO RUNS THE TRANSFER. One motor spins the front intake AND a hex shaft with
 * grippers in the transfer chute, so balls are carried up the chute while you drive.
 *
 * NOT IN THIS OPMODE: the one-wheel direction test. Use DriveAlpha for that, with the
 * robot on blocks.
 *
 * SAFE USE: keep hands, hair and loose clothing away from the shooter wheels, and keep
 * everyone out of the path of the ball.
 *
 * WHY THE STICK SIGNS ARE FLIPPED
 *   The drive subsystem uses the same convention as Pedro Pathing, Pinpoint and the turret:
 *   forward +, strafe LEFT +, turn COUNTERCLOCKWISE +. The controller's sticks are different:
 *   pushing a stick forward gives a NEGATIVE number, and pushing it right gives a POSITIVE
 *   number. So we flip the sign of all three.
 *
 * On the Driver Station, pair the controllers with Start + A (gamepad1) and Start + B (gamepad2).
 * On a PS5 controller: A = Cross, B = Circle, X = Square, Y = Triangle, bumpers = L1 / R1,
 * triggers = L2 / R2.
 *
 * Robot configuration (on the Driver Station). The names live in the subsystem classes:
 *   Motor names: left_front, left_rear, right_front, right_rear   (DriveSubsystem)
 *   Motor name:  intake                                           (IntakeSubsystem)
 *   Motor names: flywheel, hood_wheel                             (ShooterSubsystem)
 *   Servo name:  shooter_servo   (ShooterServoSubsystem, goBILDA dual mode, POSITIONAL mode)
 *   Motor name:  turret_motor    (TurretSubsystem, with its encoder cable in the same port)
 *   Ethernet Device name: limelight   (VisionSubsystem, Limelight 3A. This robot's config MUST
 *                                      have it, or this OpMode stops at INIT.)
 *   I2C Device name: pinpoint         (PinpointSubsystem, goBILDA Pinpoint Odometry Computer. If it
 *                                      is missing, the screen says so and the OpMode still runs.)
