/*
 * Vision Subsystem
 * Owns the LIMELIGHT 3A. It only READS the camera. It never moves the turret. Another class
 * (for now VisionAlpha) takes the answers from here and tells the turret what to do.
 *
 * WHAT IT ANSWERS: "Where is OUR hive's AprilTag cluster, as seen from the turret?"
 *   getTxDegrees()  -> how far LEFT or RIGHT of the camera's center the target is, PLUS the
 *                      AIM_OFFSET_DEGREES correction (zero by default).
 *                      POSITIVE means the target is to the RIGHT (that is the Limelight's rule).
 *                      Careful: the turret's angle is positive to the LEFT, so the two signs are
 *                      opposite. The OpMode that aims the turret has to flip the sign.
 *   getTyDegrees()  -> how far UP or DOWN. Positive is up. Distance will come from this later.
 *
 * HOW IT PICKS THE TARGET (each update):
 *   1. Throw away every tag that is not on OUR alliance's hive (see setAlliance()).
 *   2. Both of our cells can be in view at once. The RAISED cell is the higher one, and the
 *      higher one is the one with the larger ty, so we pick the cell holding the highest tag.
 *      THE LOCK: once we pick a cell we STAY on it, and only switch to our other cell when that
 *      one is higher by CELL_SWITCH_MARGIN_DEGREES. Without this the target would flip back and
 *      forth while the hive tips, when both cells are about the same height. If the cell we are
 *      locked on drops out of view, we wait LOCK_RELEASE_SECONDS (reporting NO_TARGET, so the
 *      turret holds) before we accept the other cell. A quick dropout, like the arm passing in
 *      front of the tags, then does not throw the lock away. After a hive tip the robot drives
 *      to the other side, so the old cell stays out of view, the lock releases, and the cell now
 *      in view becomes the new target.
 *      ONE LIMIT: if only the LOWERED cell is in view, ty alone cannot say it is lowered (that
 *      needs a distance), so we would still aim at it.
 *   3. Average tx and ty over all the visible tags in that ONE cell. Each cell has four tags
 *      spread about 13 inches across, so aiming at a single tag would aim up to 6.5 inches off
 *      center. The average lands near the middle of the cluster, which is the middle of the cell
 *      opening side to side. (The arm can hide some tags, so we use whatever is visible.)
 *   [CONFIRM] If the arm hides only the LEFT pair or only the RIGHT pair, the average shifts
 *   toward the visible side. Look at this on the real hive and tell us how big the error is.
 *
 * STATE (what we last saw) is NO_TARGET or TARGET_VISIBLE.
 * STATUS (what the camera says) is the numbers above, plus getResultAgeMs() and isCameraConnected().
 *
 * The OpMode must call update() ONCE per loop(). Nothing calls it for us.
 *
 * Robot configuration (on the Driver Station):
 *   Ethernet Device name: limelight   (Limelight 3A, USB-C to USB-A into the Control Hub's blue
 *                                      USB 3.0 port. The Control Hub sees it as an Ethernet device.)
 * The Limelight needs about 30 seconds to boot after power-up, so wait for it before testing.
 * In the Limelight's web page (http://172.29.0.1:5801 from a laptop on the Control Hub's Wi-Fi),
 * pipeline APRILTAG_PIPELINE_INDEX must be an AprilTag (Fiducial) pipeline for the 36h11 family.
