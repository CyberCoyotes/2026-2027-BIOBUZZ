/*
 * Field Constants
 * Where our robot STARTS and PARKS in Autonomous, written in Pedro's coordinates.
 * Two Autos need these numbers (LeaveAndParkAuto and ShootAndParkAuto), so they live here once.
 * (ARCHITECTURE.md: a shared constants class is made when a second class needs the value.)
 *
 * PEDRO'S MAP OF THE BIOBUZZ FIELD
 *   Picture the field the way the Competition Manual draws it, with the AUDIENCE at the BOTTOM,
 *   the RED alliance area on the LEFT and the BLUE alliance area on the RIGHT.
 *     - The ORIGIN (0, 0) is the bottom-left inside corner of the field (the corner of tile A1).
 *     - X grows to the RIGHT (toward the blue side). Y grows UP (toward the top wall).
 *     - Heading 0 degrees faces +X (right). Turning LEFT (counterclockwise) is a positive heading.
 *       So facing UP the field is +90, facing LEFT is 180, and facing DOWN is -90.
 *     - Each tile is 24 inches. Column D is X 72 to 96. Row 6 is Y 120 to 144.
 *
 * OUR BLUE PLAN (the numbers below)
 *   START  : tile D6, touching the TOP wall, facing DOWN (-90 degrees) toward the hive. The intake
 *            (front of the robot) and the turret both point at the hive, so the camera can lock
 *            on right away.
 *   PARK   : our LOADING ZONE, tile F2 on the RIGHT wall. The zone is about 11 inches deep (from
 *            the wall) and 23 inches wide (Y about 24 to 48).
 *   WAYPOINT: a stop on the way, to the right of the hive, so the robot does not clip the hive.
 *
 * RED IS A ROTATION, NOT A MIRROR
 *   Red's LOADING ZONE is at the top-LEFT and blue's is at the bottom-RIGHT, so the field is the
 *   same after turning it 180 degrees around its middle. It is NOT the same flipped left-to-right.
 *   So every red pose is the blue pose rotated 180 degrees:
 *       red X = FIELD_SIZE - blue X,   red Y = FIELD_SIZE - blue Y,   red heading = blue + 180.
 *   Blue D6 (top wall, facing down) becomes red C1 (bottom wall, facing up).
 *   We only write the BLUE numbers. The red ones are built from them in makePose(), so there are
 *   never two sets of numbers that can disagree.
 *
 * WHY THE PARK SPOT IS NOT TOUCHING THE WALL
 *   LEAVE (3 points) needs the robot to be NOT touching the perimeter wall when AUTO ends.
 *   PARK (5 points) needs the robot to be AT LEAST PARTLY inside the LOADING ZONE.
 *   So we aim the robot's edge halfway into the zone: about 5.5 inches off the wall and 5.5 inches
 *   inside the zone line. Odometry drifts a few inches, and this way a small miss in either
 *   direction still scores both.
 *
 * [CONFIRM] These are estimates read from the field pictures. Before trusting them at an event:
 *   - measure the real inside width of the field (FIELD_SIZE_INCHES),
 *   - measure the robot (ROBOT_WIDTH / LENGTH) and where its center of turning is,
 *   - check the loading zone's real depth,
 *   - drive the Auto and look at where the robot really ends up.
 *   A GitHub issue tracks the measurements.
