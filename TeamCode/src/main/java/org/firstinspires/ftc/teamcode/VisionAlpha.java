/*
 * Vision Testing
 * An iterative OpMode that tests the VisionSubsystem (the Limelight) and uses it to AIM the turret.
 *   VisionSubsystem  -> reads the Limelight: where is OUR hive's AprilTag cluster?
 *   TurretSubsystem  -> turns the turret (the same subsystem as TurretAlpha)
 * This OpMode owns NO hardware itself. It only reads the gamepads and tells the subsystems what to do.
 *
 * STEP 1: CAMERA ONLY (no turret motion). Do this first.
 *   Just INIT and watch the screen. Check:
 *     - "Limelight" shows a temperature and FPS (it is connected). It takes about 30 seconds to boot.
 *     - "Pipeline" shows the number we want. If not, see APRILTAG_PIPELINE_INDEX in VisionSubsystem.
 *     - Point the turret (by hand) at the hive. "Vision State" must say TARGET_VISIBLE.
 *     - tx is POSITIVE when the target is to the RIGHT of the camera's center, and goes to about
 *       0 when you turn the turret until the camera looks straight at the hive. If it goes the
 *       wrong way, the camera may be mounted rotated. Fix that in the Limelight's web page.
 *     - Try different distances. Where does it stop seeing the tags? Write the number down.
 *     - Try both alliances (START on gamepad 1). Only OUR alliance's tags should be used.
 *
 * STEP 2: AUTO-ALIGN. Only after Step 1 works, and with a hand near the Stop button.
 *   Do the TurretAlpha first test (encoder direction) before this. Auto-align trusts the turret angle.
 *   HOLD gamepad 2's Right Bumper. The turret turns until the target is centered, and follows it.
 *   The turret will not go past its +/-120 degree limits (see TurretSubsystem).
 *
 * GAMEPAD 1:
 *   START -> switch alliance BLUE <-> RED (one switch per press). It starts as BLUE.
 *      (Pairing the controller on the Driver Station is Start + A. If you do that while this
 *       OpMode is running, it also switches the alliance, so check the alliance after pairing.)
 *
 * GAMEPAD 2 (the same turret controls as TurretAlpha and the TeleOp):
 *   Right Bumper (HOLD) -> AUTO-ALIGN the turret to the target
 *   Left Stick X        -> turn the turret by hand (push RIGHT and the turret turns RIGHT). Beats auto-align.
 *   A                   -> STOP the turret (it floats, so you can turn it by hand). Beats everything.
 *   Letting go of the bumper or the stick holds the turret where it is.
 *
 * HOW AUTO-ALIGN WORKS
 *   The camera is ON the turret, so tx is how far the turret still has to turn. But the camera's
 *   tx is positive to the RIGHT, and the turret's angle is positive to the LEFT. So:
 *       new turret target = turret angle NOW - tx
 *   We only pick a new target when the error is bigger than ALIGN_REAIM_THRESHOLD_DEGREES. Picking
 *   a new target every loop would chase the camera's tiny wobble, and the turret's "on target"
 *   answer would keep turning off. If the target is lost, the turret HOLDS its last target.
 *   It does not search.
 *
 * "OK to shoot" for the turret needs BOTH: the camera says tx is small, AND the turret says it
 * is on target. That is the turret's half of the firing gate. (The shooter has the other half.)
 *
 * SAFE USE: the turret moves by itself in Step 2. Keep hands, hair and cables clear of it.
 *
 * Robot configuration (on the Driver Station):
 *   Ethernet Device name: limelight   (VisionSubsystem, Limelight 3A)
 *   Motor name:           turret_motor (TurretSubsystem, with its encoder cable in the same port)
