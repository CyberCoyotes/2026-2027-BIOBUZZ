/*
 * Turret Subsystem
 * Owns the motor that turns the shooter hood left and right. Only this class touches
 * the turret motor, the turret encoder, and the home switch. OpModes call its methods.
 *
 * ANGLE CONVENTION (looking down from above, the robot front / intake is at the top):
 *
 *                      0 deg   <- the HOME SWITCH, pointing at the intake
 *             +90 deg (left)     -90 deg (right)
 *               dead zone behind the robot: about +/-135 to 180 deg
 *
 *   - Angles are SIGNED. Left (counterclockwise) is POSITIVE. Right (clockwise) is NEGATIVE.
 *   - That matches how Pinpoint and Pedro Pathing measure the robot's heading, so later:
 *         shooter's field heading = robot heading + turret angle
 *   - POSITIVE motor power must turn the turret toward POSITIVE angles (left).
 *
 * HOW THE TURRET KNOWS WHERE IT IS
 *   FOR NOW the turret motor's built-in encoder counts the turret's movement (the motor's
 *   16T pinion meshes with the turret's ring gear). Later, a REV Through Bore Encoder on its
 *   own pinion can replace it (see ENCODER_TICKS_PER_REV below).
 *   An encoder only counts movement, so it needs a reference. The REV magnetic limit switch is
 *   that reference:
 *     1. Before the match, place the turret by hand ON the switch (0 degrees).
 *        If it starts on the switch, we zero right away (see setUpHardware).
 *     2. During the match, every time the turret rolls onto the switch, update() resets
 *        the angle to 0 so any drift is corrected. To stop this from firing over and
 *        over while the turret hovers at the magnet's edge, it only re-arms after the
 *        turret has moved REARM_DISTANCE_DEGREES away from home.
 *   We never reset the encoder just because an OpMode starts. The Control Hub keeps its
 *   counts between Auto and TeleOp, so the turret keeps its angle when TeleOp begins.
 *   isZeroConfirmed() is false until the switch has been seen at least once.
 *   Nothing here moves the turret at INIT, because the rules say the robot must not move
 *   after initialization (G304, G403).
 *
 * TWO WAYS TO MOVE THE TURRET
 *   1. POSITION: setTargetAngle(degrees). A small controller turns the turret there.
 *   2. MANUAL: setManualPower(power). The driver steers it with a stick.
 *   Either way the turret will not be driven past its soft limits (+/-120 degrees,
 *   see SOFT_LIMITS_ON).
 *
 * STATE (what we told it to do) is IDLE, MANUAL, or POSITION.
 * STATUS (what the sensors say) is getAngleDegrees(), isHomeSwitchActive(), isOnTarget().
 *
 * The OpMode must call update() ONCE per loop(). Nothing calls it for us.
 *
 * Robot configuration (on the Driver Station):
 *   Motor name:           turret_motor        (goBILDA 5203, 435 RPM, power on the port's power
 *                                              connector. FOR NOW its own encoder cable is plugged
 *                                              into the SAME port's 4-pin ENCODER connector.
 *                                              Later the REV Through Bore Encoder can go in that
 *                                              connector instead. One config entry either way.)
 *   HOME SWITCH IS OFF FOR NOW (not installed, code commented out). Without it, 0 degrees is
 *   wherever the turret was when the Control Hub powered on, so start with the turret
 *   straight ahead, and the angle is never re-zeroed during a match.
 *   When installed: Digital Device name: turret_home_sensor (REV magnetic limit switch. Configure it as a
 *                                              "Digital Device", NOT "REV Touch Sensor",
 *                                              because this class reads it as a DigitalChannel.)
