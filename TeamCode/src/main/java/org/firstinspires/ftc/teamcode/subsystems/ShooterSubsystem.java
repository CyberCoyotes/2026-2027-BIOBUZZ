/*
 * Shooter Subsystem
 * Owns the shooter FLYWHEEL (goBILDA 5203 series, 1620 RPM, the 3.7:1 gearbox) and the HOOD
 * WHEEL (goBILDA 5203 series, 6000 RPM, 1:1).
 * Only this class touches those two motors. OpModes call its methods.
 *
 * It has two ways to run the wheels:
 *   1. SPEED CONTROL (the normal way): setTargetRpm() / setTargetRpms().
 *      You say how fast you want each wheel in RPM, and the motor controller
 *      works to hold that speed, even as the battery drains or a ball slows the wheel.
 *   2. OPEN LOOP: setPower(). You say how much power, and the speed is whatever
 *      it ends up being. Use this for tests and for clearing a jam (negative power).
 *
 * STATE (what we told the shooter to do) is one of: IDLE, OPEN_LOOP, SPINNING_UP, READY.
 * STATUS (what the encoders report) is read with getFlywheelRpm() and friends.
 *
 * The OpMode must call update() ONCE per loop(). Nothing calls it for us.
 *
 * "RPM" in this class is the speed of the motor's OUTPUT SHAFT, worked out from the encoder.
 * (For the 1620 RPM flywheel motor that is the shaft AFTER the 3.7:1 gearbox, which is why it
 * has more encoder ticks per turn than the hood wheel motor.)
 * The belt to each wheel is believed to be 1:1, so that is also the wheel speed.
 * [CONFIRM] Check the pulleys. If a belt is not 1:1, the wheel turns at a different speed,
 * but the numbers still work because we tune the shot RPMs by measuring on the robot.
 *
 * Robot configuration (on the Driver Station):
 *   Motor name: flywheel   (goBILDA 5203 series, 1620 RPM 3.7:1, encoder plugged in)
 *   Motor name: hood_wheel   (goBILDA 5203 series, 6000 RPM, encoder plugged in)
 * Set both motors to the matching goBILDA motor type in the configuration. The
 * Control Hub's built-in speed-control numbers depend on the motor type.

    //   Ball spin comes from the DIFFERENCE in how fast the two wheel SURFACES move, and
    //   surface speed = RPM x wheel diameter. Our flywheel is on the front and about 4 inches.
    //   Our hood wheel is on the back/top side, in the fixed hood, and about 2 inches.
    //     1.0         -> same RPM, so the flywheel surface is about TWICE as fast: BACKSPIN.
    //     about 2.0   -> both surfaces move the same speed: about NO spin.
    //     more than 2 -> the hood wheel surface is faster: TOPSPIN.
    //   Our fixed hood may rub the ball and add a little backspin, so the best number for no
    //   spin could be a bit above 2.0. Test 2.0, then try a little higher or lower.

    // WATCH THE SPEED LIMIT
    //   Each wheel has its own cap (FLYWHEEL_MAX_TARGET_RPM 1458, HOOD_WHEEL_MAX_TARGET_RPM 5400).
    //   At a ratio of 2.0 the hood wheel only needs twice the flywheel's RPM, so at the top of the
    //   flywheel's range (1458) the hood wheel wants 2916, far under its cap. The FLYWHEEL is the
    //   wheel that runs out first now. Asking for more than 1458 flywheel RPM is cut down to 1458,
    //   and then the hood wheel (still twice what you asked for) is off ratio.
    //
    // 2.0 is the best ratio found so far in testing on the robot (no-spin shots). It is the
