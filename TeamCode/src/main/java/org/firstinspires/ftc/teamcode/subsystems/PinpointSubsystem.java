/*
 * Pinpoint Subsystem
 * Owns the goBILDA PINPOINT odometry computer and its two odometry pods. It only READS. It never
 * moves a motor, and it has no gamepad code. Another class (for now TeleOp - Alpha 14 and
 * PinpointAlpha) asks it where the robot is.
 *
 * WHAT IT ANSWERS: "Where is the robot, and which way is it facing, compared to where it started?"
 *   getXInches()          -> how far FORWARD of the start point. Forward is POSITIVE.
 *   getYInches()          -> how far LEFT of the start point. Left is POSITIVE.
 *   getHeadingDegrees()   -> which way the robot faces. Turning LEFT (counterclockwise) is POSITIVE.
 * Those are the same signs as DriveSubsystem and TurretSubsystem (forward +, left +, counter-
 * clockwise +), and the same as Pedro Pathing. So the turret's field direction is just:
 *   shooterFieldHeading = robotHeading + turretAngle
 * (HiveBearingMemory uses this, so the turret can keep pointing at the hive when the camera
 * loses it.)
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS: two spring-loaded (swingarm) odometry pods ride on the floor. One pod faces
 * forward (it counts when the robot drives forward or backward) and one faces sideways (it counts
 * when the robot strafes). The Pinpoint adds in its own gyro (the IMU) to work out the turning.
 * The pods are not wheels that can slip, so this is more accurate than counting drive wheel turns.
 * It still drifts a little over a whole match, so treat it as "close", not "exact".
 *
 * STATE vs STATUS: this class gives the robot no commands, so there is no state. The STATUS is
 * what the Pinpoint reports about itself (getDeviceStatus()): READY means it is working.
 *
 * ABSENT DEVICE: if the robot's configuration has no device named PINPOINT_NAME, this class does
 * NOT stop the OpMode. Every getter answers 0, isAvailable() is false, and the telemetry says
 * what to fix. (The robot can still drive. It just does not know where it is.)
 *
 * DROP LOG (a black box for finding why the Pinpoint stops saying READY): every time the status
 * goes from READY to something else, update() records the story of that "drop": which statuses it
 * went through, how long it lasted, and how far the HEADING moved while it was happening. The
 * screen shows it, and every drop is also written to the Robot Controller log (see BiobuzzLog), so
 * it can be read after the match. It changes nothing the robot does. HOW TO READ IT:
 *   - FAULT_X_POD / FAULT_Y_POD / FAULT_NO_PODS: a pod cable is loose or a pod is failing. The gyro
 *     (and so the heading) may carry on fine, so look at "heading moved": a small number means the
 *     heading survived.
 *   - FAULT_BAD_READ: the I2C cable or connector (a bad read between the Hub and the Pinpoint).
 *   - NOT_READY then CALIBRATING: the Pinpoint RESTARTED (a power or reset problem). Its heading is
 *     back at a new zero, so "heading moved" will be large.
 *   - FAULT_IMU_RUNAWAY: the gyro went wrong.
 * The log starts only after the Pinpoint has said READY once, so the normal start-up is not a drop.
 *
 * The OpMode must call update() ONCE per loop(). Nothing calls it for us.
 *
 * Robot configuration (on the Driver Station):
 *   I2C Device name: pinpoint   (type "goBILDA Pinpoint Odometry Computer", plugged into one of the
 *                                Control Hub's I2C ports 1, 2 or 3. Port 0 is the Hub's own IMU.)
 *   Last season this was named "odo". It has to be renamed once on each robot. The full steps are
 *   in TeamCode/docs/pinpoint-setup-guide.md.
 *
 * NOTE FOR AUTO: in Autonomous, Pedro Pathing reads the Pinpoint by itself (its localizer). Never
 * use this class and a Pedro Follower in the same OpMode, because both would talk to the device.
