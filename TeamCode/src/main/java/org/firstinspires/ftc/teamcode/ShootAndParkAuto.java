/*
 * Auto - Shoot and Park, Alpha 1
 * Shoots our preloaded POLLEN at the hive, then drives into our LOADING ZONE (rungs A-3 + A-1 in
 * TeamCode/docs/biobuzz-auto-strategy.md). It is LeaveAndParkAuto plus a firing sequence.
 *
 *   1. FIND_HIVE         : the turret turns until the camera is locked on the hive, and the
 *                          flywheel starts spinning at PRE_REV_FLYWHEEL_RPM so it is already
 *                          warm. As soon as the camera is locked, the shot RPM comes from the
 *                          shot table (from ty) and is kept.
 *   2. WAIT_FOR_SPEED    : the FLYWHEEL gets to the target RPM and stays there, and the turret is
 *                          on target.
 *   3. FEED_BALLS        : the gate goes CLOSED -> OPENED and the INTAKE feeds balls up the chute,
 *                          but only while the flywheel is at speed. Each ball slows the flywheel
 *                          for a moment, so the intake pauses until the flywheel recovers. Balls
 *                          go one at a time. This lasts FEED_SECONDS.
 *   4. LIFT_LAST_BALL    : the gate goes to LIFTED (it pushes the last ball in) with the intake
 *                          still running, for GATE_LIFT_SECONDS. Then the gate goes back to CLOSED,
 *                          and the intake and shooter stop.
 *   5. DRIVE_TO_WAYPOINT : slide to the right of the hive (so we do not clip it).
 *   6. DRIVE_TO_PARK     : drive down the field into the LOADING ZONE.
 *   7. DONE              : the robot holds its spot.
 *
 * IF THE SHOT CANNOT HAPPEN, SKIP IT AND PARK (we never give up the park points):
 *   - the camera is not locked on the hive after LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, or
 *   - the flywheel is not at speed after SPIN_UP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS.
 *   The screen says which one happened ("Shot skipped").
 *
 * WHY "AT SPEED" CHECKS ONLY THE FLYWHEEL (a change from Alpha 1's first test)
 *   ShooterSubsystem.isAtSpeed() needs BOTH wheels within 25 RPM, and in the first robot test it
 *   only came true after about 4 seconds. The hood wheel has far fewer encoder counts per turn
 *   (28, against the flywheel's 103.8) and runs about twice as fast, so its speed reading is a
 *   lot noisier. Here we check ONLY the flywheel (the heavy wheel, so a steady reading) and
 *   assume the hood wheel, which is set by the same ratio, is close enough. The hood wheel's
 *   error is still shown on the screen so we can check that. ShooterSubsystem and the TeleOp are
 *   NOT changed: they still use both wheels.
 *
 * THE INTAKE FEEDS THE BALLS
 *   One motor runs the intake AND the transfer chute (the TeleOp's Right Bumper "pulls balls in
 *   and carries them up the chute"). In the first robot test the gate moved but nothing pushed the
 *   balls, because the intake was off. Now it runs during the shot.
 *
 * WHAT THIS OPMODE DOES NOT DO
 *   - It does not move while shooting. The robot shoots from its start spot.
 *   - It cannot count balls (no sensor). FEED_SECONDS is a time. The screen shows how many times
 *     the flywheel dipped during the feed, which is about one dip per ball shot.
 *
 * Pedro's Follower owns the drive motors and the Pinpoint, so this OpMode does NOT use
 * DriveSubsystem or PinpointSubsystem. The shooter, gate, intake, turret, camera and shot table
 * are the same classes the TeleOp uses.
 *
 * WHERE THE ROBOT STARTS (BLUE, the default)   (all the numbers are in pedro/FieldConstants.java)
 *   Tile D6, in the middle of the tile, with the robot's BACK against the TOP wall, facing DOWN
 *   the field toward the hive (the intake and the turret point at the hive). Measure from the
 *   LEFT wall to the middle of the robot: about 82.5 inches.
 *   The robot must not touch a flower, no part of it may be in the LOADING ZONE, and it must hold
 *   exactly 4 POLLEN.
 *   RED (press B in INIT) is the same plan turned 180 degrees: tile C1, back against the BOTTOM
 *   wall, facing UP. Red has not been driven yet, so check it slowly the first time.
 *
 * BEFORE YOU RUN IT (once per robot)
 *   - The turret must have been pointing STRAIGHT AHEAD when the robot was powered on (the turret
 *     home switch is off in code, so 0 degrees is where it pointed at power-up), and it should be
 *     pointing roughly straight ahead now.
 *   - The Limelight needs about 30 seconds after power-up before it sees anything.
 *   - The driver station config must have the "limelight" Ethernet device (like the TeleOp).
 *   - To drive, Pedro must be tuned (TeamCode/docs/pedro-setup-and-auto-guide.md) and
 *     FORESIGHT_TUNED set to true. If it is NOT tuned, this OpMode still does the SHOT but does
 *     not drive, so you can test the firing sequence on its own. (Until Pedro is tuned, use
 *     EmergencyLeaveAuto to get the LEAVE points.)
 *   - Test the shot with the robot on its start spot before you trust the park: check that the
 *     camera sees the hive from there (see the INIT screen), and that the ty on the screen is
 *     near a row of the shot table.
 *
 * HOW TO RUN IT
 *   1. Put the robot on its start spot, with 4 balls loaded, and leave it STILL (INIT
 *      recalibrates the Pinpoint's gyro).
 *   2. Select "Auto - Shoot and Park - Alpha 1" and press INIT. Wait for "Pinpoint ready".
 *   3. Check the INIT screen: ALLIANCE (gamepad1 X = BLUE, B = RED), camera connected, "Hive
 *      visible: YES" and the table RPM for the start spot.
 *      TIP: type that "Table RPM from here" number into PRE_REV_FLYWHEEL_RPM, so the flywheel
 *      never has to change its target when the camera locks.
 *   4. Press START. (The 30 second timer should be ON, like in a match.)
 *
 * WHAT TO LOOK AT AFTER A RUN (the "Run log" lines stay on the screen)
 *   When the camera locked, when the flywheel was ready, how far each wheel was from its target at
 *   that moment, the ty and the table RPM, and how many flywheel dips happened during the feed.
 *   Write them in TeamCode/docs/biobuzz-test-and-match-log.md.
 *
 * WHAT TO TUNE (all at the top of this file, change one at a time)
 *   FEED_SECONDS and GATE_LIFT_SECONDS: practice until the balls leave the way you want, then
 *   leave them alone for matches. INTAKE_WAITS_FOR_SPEED (false = the intake runs the whole feed,
 *   useful to check that the balls move at all). PRE_REV_FLYWHEEL_RPM, LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS,
 *   SPIN_UP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, FLYWHEEL_AT_SPEED_TOLERANCE_RPM.
 *
 * Run it 5 times in a row before you trust it, and write each run in
 * TeamCode/docs/biobuzz-test-and-match-log.md. Once it is solid, change group = "Testing" to
 * "Competition" below.
